          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a Georgia Tech graduate as of May 2013 with a degree in Computer Science and a penchant for electronics.
            My employment tends to fall more on the web development side of things,
            and right now I'm working with a Georgia Tech Research group, Computing 4 Good, that's looking to find more ways computing can benefit the world.
            Most recently I've taken up working with Arduinos and other microcontroller projects, and I have a passion for finding ways that such technologies can be applied in our daily lives.
          </p>

            <h3>Projects I've Worked On</h3>
                <h5>C4G BLIS</h5>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="http://www.blis.cc.gatech.edu">Computing 4 Good Basic Laboratory Information System</a> is a web-based laboratory management system.
                        Currently deployed in several countries, including Tanzania and Cameroon, the development of C4G
                        BLIS focuses on a model based on direct feedback and feature requests from the end-users' laboratories.
                        The platform uses a mobile WAMP stack, which includes MySQL and PHP.
                    </p>
                <h5>Secure Health Pay</h5>
                    <p>
                        Secure Health Pay (now <a href="http://www.gopatientco.com">Patientco</a>) is a startup in the ATDC that provides simplified web-based billing solutions to healthcare providers.
                        They specialize in translating the arcane medical jargon typically present on bills into a layman-readable description,
                        and providing many simple methods of paying said bills.

                        My contributions to the product included automation of the bill generation process, and implementation of an invoicing
                        system for our customers.
                    </p>

                <h5>Arduino Projects</h5>
                    <p>
                        My interest in embedded systems programming has led to me learning Arduino prototyping tools
                        and related products.  I have experience interfacing Arduino microcontrollers to various sensors and
                        devices, including accelerometers and other components with an I2C intermediary.
                    </p>
