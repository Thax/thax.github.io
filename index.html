          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a penchant for electronics and a passion for finding new ways computers can influence our lives.

            I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2013 with a degree in Computer Science, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and Device Design/Programming.  For the last two years,
            I've been working as a software engineer for Ultimate Software, using my skills and expertise to develop novel, robust tools for configuring data templates and reducing
            client onboarding turnaround time.
          </p>

            <h3>Projects I've Worked On</h3>
                 <h5>Ultimate Software - Ultipro Carrier Network</h5>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://ultimatesoftware.com">Ultimate Software</a> is a Human Capital Management organization, providing HCM solutions and, specifically
                        to the team I worked with (The Ultipro Carrier Network), providing dyanamic data integration solutions, with the goal of reducing turnaround times for onboarding
                        new clients, and facilitating transfer of client data to vendors.

                        As the Development Lead for the .NET team on the Ultipro Carrier Network, I was primarily responsible for development of the .NET configuration tool used
                        by Integration and Technical Consultants to develop data integration templates for new clients.  I also took a role in introducing robust development practices
                        that were previously absent, including detailed version control plans using Git, as well as Unit Testing plans.
                    </p>
                <h5>C4G BLIS</h5>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="http://www.blis.cc.gatech.edu">Computing 4 Good Basic Laboratory Information System</a> is a web-based laboratory management system.
                        Currently deployed in several countries, including Tanzania and Cameroon, the development of C4G
                        BLIS focuses on a model based on direct feedback and feature requests from the end-users' laboratories.
                        The platform uses a mobile WAMP stack, which includes MySQL and PHP.
                    </p>
                <h5>Secure Health Pay</h5>
                    <p>
                        Secure Health Pay (now <a href="http://www.gopatientco.com">Patientco</a>) is a startup in the ATDC that provides simplified web-based billing solutions to healthcare providers.
                        They specialize in translating the arcane medical jargon typically present on bills into a layman-readable description,
                        and providing many simple methods of paying said bills.

                        My contributions to the product included automation of the bill generation process, and implementation of an invoicing
                        system for our customers.
                    </p>

                <h5>Arduino Projects</h5>
                    <p>
                        My interest in embedded systems programming has led to me learning Arduino prototyping tools
                        and related products.  I have experience interfacing Arduino microcontrollers to various sensors and
                        devices, including accelerometers and other components with an I2C intermediary.
